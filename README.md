Online Puzzle Hunt
==================

SPOILER ALERT: This repository has the code for this game. Don't go through it if you want to play—it contains answers.

This game is a puzzle hunt—your team starts at a virtual location with a puzzle.  You solve the puzzle and the answer leads to a new location and puzzle. We recommend playing as a team of several people. It could be your whole family, or some friends over video conferencing. Teams with a variety of backgrounds often do better. All locations for this game will be located within Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, including the panhandle.

Puzzles — Play starts with the first puzzle: a location clue which you should search in Google Maps and a written clue. Solving the puzzle will require both the written clue and something in Google Maps within 50’ of the location clue. The solution to the puzzle leads to a new location with a new written puzzle.
